RealEstatpro


RealEstatepro is a software designed to address the challenges faced by property owners in the Valle de aburrá real estate market. With property prices for both renting and buying increasing significantly across Colombia, especially in Medellín, owners are struggling to estimate rental values and forecast future sale prices. Our solution employs a linear regression model to predict rental earnings and property appreciation. Additionally, the software offers optimization recommendations for maximizing rental performance on short-term rental platforms like Airbnb. What sets RealEstatepro apart is its integration of three related functionalities into one platform, providing users with tools to fully capitalize on their properties.
